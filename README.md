# Engineering Org and Product Features Documentation

This repository contains comprehensive documentation about the engineering organization structure and product features to support effective sprint planning and cross-team collaboration.

## Documentation Overview

This documentation system provides:

- **Engineering Organization Structure**: Teams, members, responsibilities, and ownership areas
- **Product Features Catalog**: Complete feature inventory with details, dependencies, and status
- **Sprint Planning Context**: Quick reference guides linking teams to features with planning checklists
- **Kanban Planning**: Continuous flow management, WIP limits, and flow metrics for kanban-based planning

## Documentation Structure

### [Engineering Organization](./docs/engineering-org.md)

Comprehensive overview of the engineering organization including:
- Team structure and descriptions
- Team members with roles and responsibilities
- Team ownership areas and domains

- Cross-team collaboration patterns

**Use this when:**
- Planning cross-team initiatives
- Identifying team ownership for features
- Understanding team capacity and structure
- Finding the right contacts for collaboration

### [Product Features](./docs/product-features.md)

Complete catalog of product features including:
- Feature catalog with unique identifiers
- Detailed feature descriptions, requirements, and acceptance criteria
- Feature status tracking (planned, in-progress, completed, deprecated)
- Feature dependencies and relationships
- Product roadmap with priorities and timelines

**Use this when:**
- Planning sprint features
- Understanding feature dependencies
- Reviewing product roadmap
- Tracking feature status and progress

### [Sprint Planning Context](./docs/sprint-planning-context.md)

Quick reference guide for sprint planning including:
- Team-to-feature mapping
- Feature dependency visualization
- Sprint planning checklist
- Resource allocation matrix
- Cross-team coordination plans

**Use this when:**

### [Kanban Planning](./docs/kanban-planning.md)

Comprehensive guide for kanban-based continuous flow planning including:
- Kanban board structure and WIP limits
- Flow metrics and tracking (throughput, cycle time, lead time)
- Continuous planning and replenishment process
- Bottleneck identification and resolution
- Team-to-feature flow mapping

**Use this when:**

## How to Use This Documentation

### For Sprint Planning

1. Start with [Sprint Planning Context](./docs/sprint-planning-context.md) for the planning checklist
2. Review [Product Features](./docs/product-features.md) for feature priorities and dependencies
3. Check [Engineering Organization](./docs/engineering-org.md) for team capacity and ownership
4. Map features to teams using the team-to-feature mapping
5. Identify and resolve dependencies before committing to sprint goals

### For Kanban Planning

1. Review [Kanban Planning](./docs/kanban-planning.md) for board structure and WIP limits
2. Check current flow metrics (throughput, cycle time, lead time)
3. Review [Product Features](./docs/product-features.md) for backlog priorities
4. Use [Engineering Organization](./docs/engineering-org.md) to understand team capacity
5. Conduct replenishment meetings to pull new work based on capacity
6. Monitor flow and adjust WIP limits as needed

### For Feature Development

1. Find your feature in [Product Features](./docs/product-features.md)
2. Review feature details, requirements, and acceptance criteria
3. Check dependencies and coordinate with other teams if needed
4. Identify the owning team in [Engineering Organization](./docs/engineering-org.md)
5. Update feature status as work progresses

### For Cross-Team Collaboration

1. Review team structure in [Engineering Organization](./docs/engineering-org.md)
2. Identify shared dependencies in [Product Features](./docs/product-features.md)
3. Use [Sprint Planning Context](./docs/sprint-planning-context.md) to coordinate timing
4. Set up communication channels as documented

## Maintaining the Documentation

### Update Frequency

- **Engineering Organization**: Update when team structure changes (hiring, reorgs, role changes)
- **Product Features**: Update as features progress through their lifecycle
- **Sprint Planning Context**: Update before each sprint planning session
- **Kanban Planning**: Update during weekly replenishment meetings and as flow metrics change
